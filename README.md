# StockObservers
This is a small project that will take advantage of the observer pattern. This project will be built as a maven project and will use apis to collect stock prices
from Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. If the price change is updated and changed by 2% since the last days update, the registered observers will be notified of this change.
